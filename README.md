React Gallery App 🖼️

This is my seventh project for the 🏡 Treehouse Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.

In this project I created A React app that creates an image gallery. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. JSX is used to write markup-like syntax directly in the JS files and managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components.

Techniques and concepts: create-react-app, JSX, React Router, Fetch API, Flickr API
